2008-06-29 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added `Fixed Point Arithmetic' library, which provides
	  a parsing interface to the fp package. Dealing with plotting
	  files still a bit crude. 
	- This library means the manual now requires the fp pacakge 
	  to compile.
	- Fixed floor function for negative numbers.
	- Fixed \pgfmathsetseed.
	- Font and group fix for external documentation.

2008-06-27 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Complete change of TikZ intersections (PGF unchanged).
  - Slight hack of the TikZ scopes library to permit local
    path naming. Should work...
    
2008-06-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Continued with circuit library.
	- Introduced subdirectories inside the pgf library
	  directory and moved libs into them.
	  You may need to update your checkout.

2008-06-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- The external library now typesets as horizontal material by issueing
	  \leavevmode. This fixes an inconsistency with the normal tikzpictures.

2008-06-25 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added intersection library + documentation for 
	  intersecting ``named'' paths.
  
2008-06-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed bug in external library. Now, strings like '#1' occuring 
	  somewhere in an image is collected correctly.

2008-06-24 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Removed new intersection stuff. Need to restart from scratch...

2008-06-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Started working on circuit library documentation.

2008-06-23 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added PGF code and docs for intersections of two curves and 
	  intersections of a line and a curve.
	- Fixed bug in foreach code when registers are used with dots
	  statement.
			  
2008-06-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Created first version of circuit libraries for electrical
	  engineering (circuits.ee.*). 
	- Added libraries so that ee circuits and logical circuits can
	  be accessed using the same interface. (circuits.logic.*)
	- The tikz lib shapes.gates.logic.* will no
	  longer be needed, the circuits.logic.* will replace them. (The
	  pgf libs shapes.gates.* are still used as before, however.)
	- Minor patch in shapes.gates.logic.US so that the .0 and .180
	  anchors of a not gate or a buffer gate are the same as the
	  input or output anchors.
	- All this is not documented, yet.
	- Worked some more on dv stuff, but nothing to "show", yet.

2008-06-21 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed parsing bug in foreach code.
	- Added "rotate fit" key to fit library, so (e.g.) a rotated 
	  rectangle can be fitted around nodes/coordinates.

2008-06-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added documentation for tikz 'external' library.
	- created pgfexternalwithdepth.tex file to use the 'baseline' information.
	- improved some issues of the external library.
	- Added '/pgf/images/draft' option
	- Modified implementation of draft images to show the image file name
	instead of the internal image name

2008-06-19 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added tikz library 'external' which allows automatic or semiautomatic 
	  export of each tikzpicture to pdf. Documentation is not yet ready.
	- Added self-contained latex package tikzexternal.sty to read those images
	  without tikz/pgf installed.
	- Added support for the 'baseline' option in \beginpgfgraphicnamed ... \endpgfgraphicnamed
	  by storing the box depth into a separate file.

2008-06-19 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added first ideas for a circuit library.
	- Bugfixes in scoping behaviour.
	- Changed scoping rules for to path operation: Options are now
	  local. This may break existing code, but is much more
	  consistent with everything else and removes other problems. 
	- Patched mindmap lib to account for these changed rules.
	- Added insert path option.
	- Deprecated "after node path". Use "append after command" and
	  "prefix after command" instead.
	- Moved datavisualization libraries to separate subdirectory.

2008-06-18 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Changed label and pin options once again, to allow more
	  flexibility. In particular, the angle can now be
	  omitted. Also, for rotated main nodes the anchors are now
	  chosen in more sensible ways.

2008-06-16 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added tiny little turtle graphics library for fun.
	- Changed scoping rules for \foreach statement on a path: the
	  last coordinate is now persistent not only after the foreach
	  statement, but also between different iterations.
	- Changed positioning of "label" when you attach a label to a
	  transformed shape. The position is now absolute with respect
	  to the page, unless the "transform shape" option is used.
	
2008-06-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed the bug fix for character checking in foreach.
	- Updates and fixes for new foreach code.

2008-06-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed bug in new \foreach stuff that causes an error on
	  things like \foreach \i in {1,...,\foo}. If a list element
	  is a macro, no is-it-a-character check is done.

2008-06-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Checked in proposed \foreach extensions. Possibly the
	  extensions would be better contained in a pgflibrary...
	- list items can now be evaluated.
	- dots replacement is context sensitive.
	- sequences indicated by dots can be character sequences.
	- a list item can be ``remembered'' in the next iteration.
	- access to the number of the current item in the list is
	  provided. 

2008-06-09 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Worked a bit on data visualization stuff.
	
2008-06-07 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added '/pgf/number format/1000 sep' and 'dec sep' shortcut 
	  styles which simply call 'set thousands separator' and 'set 
	  decimal separator'. Those option are somewhat long...

2008-06-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed the "local bounding box" option so that it honors the
	  "relevant for picture size"-if.
	
2008-06-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed buggy "mid left" and "mid right" options.
	- Added "between positions" option to the "mark" option. This
	  makes it possible to create paths with "repeated arrows along
	  the path". This did not work before.

2008-06-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added '/pgf/number format/assume math mode' to disable math checks. 
	  This allows to assemble tabulars, apply \pgfmathprintnumber to each cell
	  and use the dcolumn package to align at decimal separators (no
	  documentation for that feature yet)

2008-06-02 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed pgfpages in conjunction with everyshi.

2008-05-31 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Semantics of |/pgf/number format/fixed zerofill| changed: it now simply
	  sets a boolean which affects all numbers in fixed format; it does not
	  SET fixed format. The same holds for sci zerofill.

2008-05-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Provided \pgfmathprintnumberto macro in addition to
	  \pgfmathprintnumber.

2008-05-22 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Revised Lindenmayer system stuff. Documentation should 
	  now be up to date.

2008-05-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added 'xbar interval' and 'ybar interval' plot handlers.
	- Moved plot handler options to /pgf key tree.
	- added 'bar shift' option.
	- bar width option is now evaluated when needed.
	- Added documentation for plot handler library changes and for tikz-plot
	  interfaces.
	- Modified pgf manual macros: codeexamples section now employs pgfkeys,
	  xkeyval no longer required. Introduced style 'every codeexample' to
	  maintain compatibility and allow customization for users.

2008-05-21 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added missing documentation of moveto-decoration.

2008-05-20 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Changed the processing of \pgflsystemstep. Now a TeX
	  dimension, it permits a symbol to shorten the step.

2008-05-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added Lindemayer system drawing library.
	- Renamed the ranomization keys for the step and angle.
	- Updated the L-system docs.

2008-05-19 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added documentation of oo-subsystem.
	- Started documentation of data visualization-subsystem.
	- Fixed hyperlink problem in dvipdfm(x)/xetex.
	- Fixed typos in Lindemayer system doc.

2008-05-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added \pgfmathfloatadd, \pgfmathfloatsubtract and
	\pgfmathfloatmultiplyfixed based on pgf's normal math parser
	- Added tests for float arithmetics
	- Added \pgfmathfloattoextentedprecision for 8-digit mantisse precision
	- Added documentation for these methods
	- Added basic layer input stream methods to set zero levels for [xy]comb/[xy]bar;
	allows to start bars at different offsets than x=0 / y=0.
	- Added documentation for zero level streams.

2008-05-15 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added "path picture" option, mostly for the implementation
	  of the corrected mindmap connecting bars.
	- Fixed buggy code of mindmap connect bars: Shading angles
	  where sometimes wrong and shading was sometimes at the wrong
	  position.  

2008-05-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Completely rewrote management of pdf resources. This affects
	  pdftex, dvipdfm, dvipdfmx and xetex backends and all front
	  ends. They should now all work together in harmony, as far
	  as this is supported by them.
	- Completely rewrote driver detection in plain and context
	  mode. 
	- dvipdfmx and xetex now use \special{pdf:literal direct},
	  which can *considerably* reduce file sizes (up to a factor
	  of 2).

2008-05-14 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed compatability issue with old calc code.
	
2008-05-13 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- documented '.lasttry' key handler
	- introduced documentation for key filtering routines (as \input section
	in pgfmanual-en-pgfkeys.tex). Main section of pgfkeys not really updated
	yet; I only removed the 'family limitation' item in the introduction.

2008-05-11 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Multiple fixes for signal shape.

2008-05-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added \pgfplotbarwidth and docs
	- used \pgfmathparse to assign \pgfsetplotbarwidth
	- added 'const plot mark right' to plot handler library to complete the
	different variants of left/right connected/jump handlers.

2008-05-01 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed parser for expressions that begin and end with braces.

2008-04-27 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Added \pgfmathapproxequalto operation and documentation below
	\pgfmathequalto
	- Added some user-interface methods to floating point arithmetics
	- Added options
		/pgf/number format/set decimal separator
		/pgf/number format/set thousands separator
		/pgf/number format/skip 0.
	- Added documentation for floating point arithmetics
	- Added documentation for number printing

2008-04-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added PGF plot handlers to plot handler library:
		- \pgfplothandlerxbar
		- \pgfplothandlerybar
	  with parameter \pgfsetplotbarwidth{} and
	    - \pgfplothandlerconstantlineto
		- \pgfplothandlerjumpmarkleft
		- \pgfplothandlerjumpmarkright
	- Added Tikz-Plot handlers
		- /tikz/xbar
		- /tikz/ybar
	  with option '/tikz/bar width' and
		- /tikz/const plot
		- /tikz/jump mark left
		- /tikz/jump mark right
	- Added documentation for new plot handlers to Tikz- and plot handler
	section in manual

2008-04-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Documented changed double line handling.
	- Made some arrow tips work with double lines.

2008-04-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added (not yet documented) "inner lines", which move the
	  double line mechanism from tikz to the basic layer. This
	  allows the definition of special arrow tips for double lines.
	- Added (not yet documented) new arrow tip "implies" using
	  this mechanism.

2008-04-21 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- New version of rectangle split shape. Now supports horizontal
	  as well as vertical spliting. Also supports up to 20 parts. 

2008-04-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added pgfkeysfiltered.code.tex which provides key filtering
	  and provides key-selection utilities like xkeyvals families
	- changed pgfkeys.code.tex to '\input' pgfkeysfiltered.code.tex

2008-04-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added \tikzaddtikzonlycommandshortcutlet and
	  \tikzaddtikzonlycommandshortcutdef to install shortcut commands at the
	  beginning of tikzpicture.
	- pgfkeys.code.tex: fixed incompatibility .try with .is choice

2008-04-10 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed patterns in dvips mode (were broken).
	
2008-04-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Switched to everyshi in latex mode to hack into
	  \shipout. Wrote direct code to hack into \shipout in plain
	  mode. Hacking into \shipout in Context is still unclear.
	- Added space arrow.
	
2008-4-02 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Reimplemented parsing of operands. 

2008-04-01 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added cirlce solidus shape by Manuel Lacruz.

2008-03-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- `curve control points' decoration no longer exists. It is 
	  replaced by the `show path construction' decoration.
	- added code + docs for defining changable patterns.
	- Parser altered to access \pgfmathfloatparsenumber when 
	  \ifpgfmathfloat is true (old interface to \pgfmathfloat deleted).

2008-03-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added generic/pgf/math/pgfmathfloat.code.tex
	- Modified pgfmath.code.tex to include pgfmathfloat.code.tex
	- Added generic/pgf/testsuite/mathtest/pgfmathtestsuite.tex [dvipdfm/pdflatex]
	  which provides testing for pgfmathfloat.code.tex

2008-03-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed minimum width handling in rounded rectangle shape. 

2008-03-12 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added key for rectangle split to ignore empty parts.
	- Extended \pgfshadecolortorgb to define macros for the
	  individual color components.

2008-03-08 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added `curve control points' decoration for drawing
	  curve controls. NB: names/keys may change.

2008-03-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fix for (some) `hidden' bugs: ``Missing character: 
	  There is no <char> in font nullfont!''. This is usually
	  only seen in log file. Fixed for star, circular sector
	  and math macros.

2008-03-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed documentation "placment" replaced by "positioning"
	- Fixed ConTeXt page resource problem. (ConTeXt support is
	  still not as smooth as support of other formats)
	- Checked in some data visualization stuff, without any
	  documentation. Everything still likely to change
	  completely. 
	- Moved module management to pgfutil.
	- Added support for simple oo-programming, not documented. 

2008-02-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed bug in pgfkeysaddvalue.
	- Fixed bug of stack leak in function shadings in postscript.
	- Fixed missing image inclusion documentation.
	- Fixed atan bug in documentation example.
	- Fixed missing dependency of chains--positioning library
	- Fixed missing dependency of mindmap--decorations library

2008-02-20 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	Released version 2.00

2008-02-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed "initial"/"accepting" distance bug.
	- Fixed wrong intersection computation bug.
	
2008-02-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added "local bounding box" option for Fabien...

2008-02-12 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Finished chains and chain tutorial.
	- Fixed height of rounded rectangle shape.
	
2008-02-11 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added "auto end on length" and "auto corner on length"
	  options to decorations.
	- Added "if input segment is closepath" option to
	  decorations. 
	- Renamed "subpath" in decoration code to "inputsegment". In
	  the pdf-specification (and in the rest of the pgf manual) a
	  path is made up of subpath, which are started by movetos,
	  and these in turn are made up of segments. In decorations,
	  segments used to be called subpaths, which was too
	  confusing... 
	- More renaming in chains, but its stabilizing now.
	- Started a tutorial on chains.
	
2008-02-10 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Moved chain part inside "positioning" into "chains"
	  library. 
	- Renamed things in the chains library, yet again and added
	  branches.
	- Fixed bug with "xyz of" placements.

2008-02-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Renamed "placements" library to "positioning".
	- Renamed and changed all chain commands.
	- Added scopes library.
	- Renamed cap and join to line cap and line join (but old ones
	  are still available).

2008-02-07 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Patched Makefiles according to suggestion by Hans Meine.
	- Fixed bug: duplicate fading name in pgflibraryfadings.
	- Fixed bug: wrong size of functional shading in dvips.
	- Fixed bud: documentation a4paper setting.
	- Fixed bug: Manual now compiles with tex4ht once more.
	- Fixed bug: Manual now is hyperlinked also for dvipdfm.
	- Fixed bug: wrong size of all shadings in svg code.
	- Slight change in placement lib, default chain now has a
	  name. 

2008-02-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Removed internal asin tables as asin is now calculated from 
	  acos tables.
	- Misc. updates for shapes docs.


2008-02-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Changed fit library, so that nodes are now "completely"
	  fitted. 
	- Changed tutorial so that fit library is now used.
	- Added placement library and documentation.

2008-02-05 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixes in snake compatibility code.
	- Added dvipdfmx support (identical to dvipdfm).
	- Fixed missing braces and color stack problem in
	  shapes.logic.IEC. 

2008-02-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Patched (and hopefully fixed) hyperref support.
	- Made matrix inversion more precise.
	- Added tutorial for geometric constructions.
	- Fixed partway and intersection computations.
	- Added line to circle intersection.

2008-02-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Added through library (still very simple...).
	- Added computation of intersection of circles and tangent to
	  a circle.

2008-01-31 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Updated isosceles triangle shape. Positioning of node
	  contents improved. Added key so minimum width and height
	  can be applied independently
	- Fix for trapezium shape for minimum height. This fix may
	  ``break'' exisiting code by making any trapezium enlarged using
	  minimum height to appear slightly wider than before. But...
	- Added keys for trapezium so that minimum width and height
	  can be applied independently, or to just the `body' of the
	  trapezium. 

2008-01-30 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Reimplemented shape `tape'. Anchors should behave a bit
	  better now.

2008-01-29 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed problem with pin a relative coordinates.

2008-01-27 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added `logic gate IEC symbol color` key to change color
	  for all symbols simultaneously.
	- Fix for loading US and IEC shape library separately.
	- Misc. updates for decoration docs.

2008-01-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Modified calc library. Working on documentation.
	- Added calc library and ($...$) notation for coordinates.

2008-01-25 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Reorganised logic shapes. Now two libraries:
	  shapes.gates.logic.US (for `American' gates) and 
	  shapes.gates.logic.IEC (for rectangular gates).
	  Gates are now named `and gate US' or `and gate IEC' etc.
	  TikZ key `use US style logic gates' and `use IEC style
	  logic gates' set up styles so that (e.g.) `and gate' 
	  becomes a synonym for `shape=and gate US'. See docs for
	  details.

2008-01-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added decorations.markings.

2008-01-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed pgfpatharc: Fractional angles are now handled
	  correctly. 
	- Fixed incompatability with bm package: Changed hack to
	  \@@end to \AtEndDocument.
	- Changed things in the math engine to speed up things: First,
	  \pgfmath@returnone now uses simpler and faster code. Second,
	  some marshals in the internal math commands like
	  \pgfmathadd@ have been removed. This makes it necessary that
	  the second operand in a call to an internal math macro no
	  longer uses \pgf@x or \pgf@xa and I fixed the 3 places where
	  this was the case.
	- Added footprint decoration and merged Marks footprints.
	- Added buffering to the subpath mechanism. This speeds up
	  constructions of very long paths by a factor of 10 or more. 
	- Fixed missing declaration of \iftikz@decoratepath in
	  tikz.code.tex. 

2008-01-22 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Added logic shapes library. Includes AND gate, NAND gate,
	  OR gate, NOR gate, XOR gate, XNOR gate and NOT gate.

2008-01-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fooled around with title page.
	- Changed TikZ path scoping rules: Scopes no longer affect the
	  last point on a path. This was a nuiseance before and became
	  a real problem with decorations.
	- Finished my move from snakes to decorations. Also finished
	  documentation. 
	  We are now ready for a new release!
	
2008-01-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Removed \externalcode command for decoration states as
	  persistent pre/postcomputation stuff does a similar job.	  

2008-01-18 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Added \externalcode command for decoration states. Allows
	  code to be executed outside the TeX-group the state code
	  is executed in.

2008-01-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Split decoration lib into several libs. 
	- Renamed lineto decoration to curveto decoration.
	- Renamed many keys of decorations and snakes to shorter
	  names.
	- Changed the tikz setting of decoration options.
	- No documentation yet.

2008-01-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Started merging snakes and decorations. Not yet finished.

2008-01-16 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- (Partly) rewrote the tikz support for decorations. There is
	  now a "decorate" path command:
	  \draw ... decorate [decoration=zigzag] { (0,0) -- (1,2) };
          This yields a much cleaner interface.
	- There is also a decorate=true/false option that causes the
	  whole path to be decorated.
	- Decorated path can now contain nodes.
	- Node paths can also be decorated now.
	- Fixed missing \pgftransformreset inside decoration
	  environment. 
	
2008-01-15 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Changed the decoration documentation a bit. Still not quite
  	  perfect... 
	- Restructured the basic layer. There is a central core (which
	  got slightly larger) and "modules", which can be included
	  using \usepgfmodule. All the pgfbaseXXX files are now
	  obsolete and only included for the old ones for
