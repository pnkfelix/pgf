2008-02-13 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added "local bounding box" option for Fabien...

2008-02-12 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Finished chains and chain tutorial.
	- Fixed height of rounded rectangle shape.
	
2008-02-11 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added "auto end on length" and "auto corner on length"
	  options to decorations.
	- Added "if input segment is closepath" option to
	  decorations. 
	- Renamed "subpath" in decoration code to "inputsegment". In
	  the pdf-specification (and in the rest of the pgf manual) a
	  path is made up of subpath, which are started by movetos,
	  and these in turn are made up of segments. In decorations,
	  segments used to be called subpaths, which was too
	  confusing... 
	- More renaming in chains, but its stabilizing now.
	- Started a tutorial on chains.
	
2008-02-10 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Moved chain part inside "positioning" into "chains"
	  library. 
	- Renamed things in the chains library, yet again and added
	  branches.
	- Fixed bug with "xyz of" placements.

2008-02-08 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Renamed "placements" library to "positioning".
	- Renamed and changed all chain commands.
	- Added scopes library.
	- Renamed cap and join to line cap and line join (but old ones
	  are still available).

2008-02-07 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Patched Makefiles according to suggestion by Hans Meine.
	- Fixed bug: duplicate fading name in pgflibraryfadings.
	- Fixed bug: wrong size of functional shading in dvips.
	- Fixed bud: documentation a4paper setting.
	- Fixed bug: Manual now compiles with tex4ht once more.
	- Fixed bug: Manual now is hyperlinked also for dvipdfm.
	- Fixed bug: wrong size of all shadings in svg code.
	- Slight change in placement lib, default chain now has a
	  name. 

2008-02-07 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Removed internal asin tables as asin is now calculated from 
	  acos tables.
	- Misc. updates for shapes docs.


2008-02-06 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Changed fit library, so that nodes are now "completely"
	  fitted. 
	- Changed tutorial so that fit library is now used.

	  shapes.logic.IEC. 

2008-02-04 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Patched (and hopefully fixed) hyperref support.
	- Made matrix inversion more precise.
	- Added tutorial for geometric constructions.
	- Fixed partway and intersection computations.
	- Added line to circle intersection.

2008-02-03 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Added through library (still very simple...).
	- Added computation of intersection of circles and tangent to
	  a circle.

2008-01-31 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Updated isosceles triangle shape. Positioning of node
	  contents improved. Added key so minimum width and height
	  can be applied independently
	- Fix for trapezium shape for minimum height. This fix may
	  ``break'' exisiting code by making any trapezium enlarged using
	  minimum height to appear slightly wider than before. But...
	- Added keys for trapezium so that minimum width and height
	  can be applied independently, or to just the `body' of the
	  trapezium. 

2008-01-30 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Reimplemented shape `tape'. Anchors should behave a bit
	  better now.

2008-01-29 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed problem with pin a relative coordinates.

2008-01-27 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	  for all symbols simultaneously.
	- Fix for loading US and IEC shape library separately.
	- Misc. updates for decoration docs.

2008-01-26 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Modified calc library. Working on documentation.
	- Added calc library and ($...$) notation for coordinates.

2008-01-25 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Reorganised logic shapes. Now two libraries:
	  shapes.gates.logic.US (for `American' gates) and 
	  shapes.gates.logic.IEC (for rectangular gates).
	  Gates are now named `and gate US' or `and gate IEC' etc.
	  TikZ key `use US style logic gates' and `use IEC style
	  logic gates' set up styles so that (e.g.) `and gate' 
	  becomes a synonym for `shape=and gate US'. See docs for
	  details.

2008-01-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added decorations.markings.

2008-01-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed pgfpatharc: Fractional angles are now handled
	  correctly. 
	- Fixed incompatability with bm package: Changed hack to
	  \@@end to \AtEndDocument.
	- Changed things in the math engine to speed up things: First,
	  \pgfmath@returnone now uses simpler and faster code. Second,
	  some marshals in the internal math commands like
	  \pgfmathadd@ have been removed. This makes it necessary that
	  the second operand in a call to an internal math macro no
	  longer uses \pgf@x or \pgf@xa and I fixed the 3 places where
	  this was the case.
	- Added footprint decoration and merged Marks footprints.
	- Added buffering to the subpath mechanism. This speeds up
	  constructions of very long paths by a factor of 10 or more. 
	- Fixed missing declaration of \iftikz@decoratepath in
	  tikz.code.tex. 

2008-01-22 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Added logic shapes library. Includes AND gate, NAND gate,
	  OR gate, NOR gate, XOR gate, XNOR gate and NOT gate.

2008-01-22 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fooled around with title page.
	- Changed TikZ path scoping rules: Scopes no longer affect the
	  last point on a path. This was a nuiseance before and became
	  a real problem with decorations.
	- Finished my move from snakes to decorations. Also finished
	  documentation. 
	  We are now ready for a new release!
	
2008-01-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Removed \externalcode command for decoration states as
	  persistent pre/postcomputation stuff does a similar job.	  

2008-01-18 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Added \externalcode command for decoration states. Allows
	  code to be executed outside the TeX-group the state code
	  is executed in.

2008-01-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Split decoration lib into several libs. 
	- Renamed lineto decoration to curveto decoration.
	- Renamed many keys of decorations and snakes to shorter
	  names.
	- Changed the tikz setting of decoration options.
	- No documentation yet.

2008-01-17 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Started merging snakes and decorations. Not yet finished.

2008-01-16 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- (Partly) rewrote the tikz support for decorations. There is
	  now a "decorate" path command:
	  \draw ... decorate [decoration=zigzag] { (0,0) -- (1,2) };
          This yields a much cleaner interface.
	- There is also a decorate=true/false option that causes the
	  whole path to be decorated.
	- Decorated path can now contain nodes.
	- Node paths can also be decorated now.
	- Fixed missing \pgftransformreset inside decoration
	  environment. 
	
2008-01-15 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Changed the decoration documentation a bit. Still not quite
  	  perfect... 
	- Restructured the basic layer. There is a central core (which
	  got slightly larger) and "modules", which can be included
	  using \usepgfmodule. All the pgfbaseXXX files are now
	  obsolete and only included for the old ones for
	  compatibility.
	  The {pgf} package no longer includes the modules "pattern",
	  "snakes" and "decorations" by default. However, these
	  modules are loaded by their respective libraries, so,
	  normally, no one will notice.	
	
2008-01-15 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Fix for minimum size in ellipse split shape.
	- Added decorations documentation.

2008-01-14 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Coordinates like (2,3cm) are now allowed. Has the same
	  effect as ([shift={(2,0)}]0pt,3cm), which is what everybody
	  would expect.
	- Moved tikz hacks inside tikzlibrarydecorations into
	  tikz.code.tex itself.

2008-01-14 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Fix for save stack overflow in decorations.
	- Renamed \pgfdecorate \endpgfdecorate, now \pgfdecoration
	  \endpgfdecoration. Makes it more consistent with...
	- Meta decorations! Automata that decorate the path with
	  decoration automata! Increased fancyness! Docs soon.
	- Removed a bunch of keys from \tikzlibrarydecorations as
	  not really necessary.	

2008-01-13 Till tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Changed shadow lib once more and added it to CVS.

2008-01-13 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added decorations files. Docs to follow soon(ish).

2007-11-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- Corrected minimum size of a diamond shape (was twice the
	  correct size -- this may break existing code, but that cannot
	  be avoided!).
	- Changed some more documentation from \itemoption to {key}s. Not
 	  yet finished.
	
2007-11-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed insertion of spaces after \pgfmath stuff.
	- Fixed bug #1811862.

2007-09-19 Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

        - Fix for cot and tan. Now correctly return negative values.
        - Added `...head indent' option for single and doube arrow
          shapes (allows the arrowheads to look more `fancy').
        - Updated tikzshapes.geometric and tikzshapes.symbols so
          the incircle border construction can be used in TikZ
          if libraries are loaded separately.
        - Misc. fixes and updates for shapes doc.

2007-09-18  Mark Wibrow <vibrovski@users.sourceforge.net>

        - Fixed parser for expressions beginning with groups
          preceeded by signs e.g. -(4+3)
        - This also fixes problem in TikZ when specifiying coordinates
          contatining groups. Coordinates in the form (1, {(2+3)}) will
          work even if there are spaces after the comma.
