\section{Shape Library}

In addition to the standard shapes |rectangle|, |circle| and
|coordinate|, there exist a number of additional shapes defined in
different shape libraries. Some of these shapes have been contributed
by Mark Wibrow. In the present section, these shapes are
described.


\begin{pgflibrary}{shapes}
  This library packages just includes all of the libraries defined in
  the following. Note that it includes only those libraries starting
  with |shapes.|, more special-purpose libraries are described in
  dedicated sections.
\end{pgflibrary}


\subsection{Geometric Shapes}

\begin{pgflibrary}{shapes.geometric}
  This library defines different shapes that correspond to basic
  geometric objects like ellipses or polygons.
\end{pgflibrary}


\begin{shape}{diamond}
  This shape is a diamond tightly fitting the text box. The ratio
  between width and height is 1 by default, but can be changed by
  setting the shape aspect ratio (using the |aspect| option of
  \tikzname). The following figure shows the anchors this
  shape defines; the anchors |10| and |130| are example of border anchors.
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s,shape=diamond,style=shape example] {Diamond\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {north west/above left, north/above, north east/above right, 
     west/left, center/above, east/right, 
     mid/above, 
     base/below,  
     south west/below left, south/below, south east/below right, 
     text/left, 10/right, 130/above}
     \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
       node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{shape}

\begin{shape}{ellipse}
  This shape is an ellipse tightly fitting the text box, if no inner
  separation is given. The following figure shows the anchors this
  shape defines; the anchors |10| and |130| are example of border anchors.
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s,shape=ellipse,style=shape example] {Ellipse\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {north west/above left, north/above, north east/above right, 
     west/left, center/above, east/right, 
     mid west/right, mid/above, mid east/left, 
     base west/left, base/below, base east/right, 
     south west/below left, south/below, south east/below right, 
     text/left, 10/right, 130/above}
     \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
       node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{shape}

\begin{shape}{trapezium}
	This shape is a trapezium, that is, a quadrilateral with a single
	pair of parallel lines (this can sometimes be known as a trapezoid). 
	By default, the the lower corners of the trapezium are extended 
	(i.e., `stick out') by a distance of 1.5ex, but each can be extended 
	independently.	

	
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[trapezium, draw]
   \node at (0,1) {A};
   \node[trapezium left extension=10pt, trapezium right extension=20pt]
         at (0,0) {B};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

   Negative extensions result in the upper points being extended. This
   means that parallelograms can be created (but technically these are
   not trapezia, as they have more than one pair of parallel sides).
   These extensions are in addition to the natural dimensions of the
   node contents.
   
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[trapezium, draw]
   \node[trapezium left extension=10pt, trapezium right extension=20pt]
         at (0,2) {A};
   \node[trapezium left extension=-10pt, trapezium right extension=-20pt]
         at (0,1) {B};
   \node[trapezium left extension=-10pt, trapezium right extension=10pt]
         at (0,0) {C};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

	There are \pgfname{} commands and \tikzname{} options to set the 
  	extensions of the trapezium. The \pgfname{} commands are as follows:
	
	\begin{command}{\pgftrapeziumleftextension\marg{length}}
    Set the distance that the lower left corner `sticks out'. If 
    \meta{length} is negative, the upper left corner is adjusted.
   \end{command}
   
   \begin{command}{\pgftrapeziumrightextension\marg{length}}
    Set the distance that the lower right corner `sticks out'. If 
    \meta{length} is negative, the upper right corner is adjusted.
   \end{command}
   
   \begin{command}{\pgftrapeziumextension\marg{length}}
    Set the distance that both the lower left and lower right corner 
    `stick out'. If \meta{length} is negative, the upper corners are
    adjusted.
   \end{command}
   
   The corresponding \tikzname{} options are:

  \begin{itemize}
    \itemoption{trapezium left extension}|=|\meta{length}
    set the extension for the lower left corner (negative values adjust
    the upper left corner).
    
    \itemoption{trapezium right extension}|=|\meta{length}
    set the extension for the lower right corner (negative values adjust
    the upper right corner).
    
    \itemoption{trapezium extension}|=|\meta{length}
    set the extension for both lower corners (negative values adjust
    the upper corners).
    
  \end{itemize}
  
 	The anchors for the trapezium are shown below. The anchor |75| is an
	example of a border anchor.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s, shape=trapezium, trapezium extension=2cm, style=shape example, inner sep=1.5cm] 
    {Trapezium\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {center/above,   text/left,      mid/right,   75/above, base/below,     
     west/above,     east/above,     north/below,    south/above,
     north west/above, north east/above, south west/below, south east/below}
  \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
    node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
   
\end{shape}


\begin{shape}{regular polygon}
  This shape is a regular polygon, which, by default, is drawn so that a side
  (rather than a corner) is always at the bottom. 
  
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \foreach \i in {5,...,8}
    	\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=\i, draw] at (\i,0)  {\i};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

  Two points should be remembered regarding the dimensions of the
  polygon border. Firstly, the border is constructed using the incircle, that is, the
  circle that touches every side of the polygon border. The radius of
  the incircle is calculated to tightly fit the node contents.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \foreach \a in {3,...,7}{
    \draw[gray!50] (\a*2,0)  circle(0.5cm);
    \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=\a,
          inner sep=0cm, text=red!50, draw] 
          at (\a*2,0) {\vrule height 0.707cm width 0.707cm};
   }  
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}	
	
  Secondly, if the node is enlarged to any specified minimum size, 
  width or height, this is interpreted as the diameter of the the 
  circumcircle, that is, the circle that passes through all the 
  corners of the polygon border.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \foreach \a in {3,...,7}{
    \draw[gray!50] (\a*2,0)  circle(0.5cm);
    \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=\a, minimum size=1cm, draw] at (\a*2,0) {};
   }  
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}	

  There are \pgfname{} commands and \tikzname{} options to set the 
  number of sides for the polygon, and the rotation of the polygon 
  border. The \pgfname{} commands are as follows:
	
  \begin{command}{\pgfsetpolygonsides\marg{integer}}
    Set the number of sides for the polygon.
  \end{command}
  
  \begin{command}{\pgfsetpolygonrotate\marg{angle}}
    Rotate the border of the polygon independently of the node
    contents (but in addition to any concurrent coordinate or canvas
    transformation).
  \end{command}
  
  The corresponding \tikzname{} options are:

  \begin{itemize}
    \itemoption{regular polygon sides}|=|\meta{integer}
    set the number of points for the star.
    
    \itemoption{regular polygon rotate}|=|\meta{angle}
    rotate the border of the polygon independently of the node
    contents.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The anchors for the regular polygon shape are shown below.  
  The anchor |75| is an example of a border anchor.
   
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s, shape=regular polygon, regular polygon sides=5, style=shape example, inner sep=.5cm] 
    {Regular Polygon\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {corner 1/above, corner 2/above, corner 3/left, corner 4/right, 
     corner 5/above, side 1/left,    side 2/left,   side 3/below,
     side 4/right,   side 5/right,   mid/right,     base/below, 
     center/above,   text/left,      75/above,      west/above, 
     east/above,     north/below,    south/above}
  \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
    node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
	
\end{shape}

\begin{shape}{simple isosceles triangle}

	\pgfname{} and \tikzname{} offer two kinds of isosceles triangle. 
	The \emph{simple} isosceles triangle is an isosceles triangle 
	that tightly fits the node contents, according to the specified 
	angle at the apex of the triangle (this defaults to 45 degrees). 

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[simple isosceles triangle, draw]
   \node [isosceles triangle apex angle=30] at (0,2) {A};
   \node [isosceles triangle apex angle=60] at (0,1) {B};
   \node [isosceles triangle apex angle=120] at (0,0) {C};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}	

	The other isosceles triangle (described below) uses the incircle to 
	determine the border. By not using the incircle to determine the node 
	border, the |simple isosceles triangle| ensures a tighter fit to the 
	node contents. However, there are restrictions on the angles to which
	the border can be rotated (as with the |regular polygon| shape, border 
	rotation is independent of the node contents, but in addition to any 
	canvas or coordinate transformations). 
	The border of the |simple isosceles triangle| shape can only be rotated 
	to 90, 270, 180 or 0 degrees, which (minus any transformations), means
	the triangle can only point up, down, left and right. 

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[simple isosceles triangle, inner sep=1pt, draw]
   \node[text=red!50] at (1,1) {\vrule height 20pt width 10pt};
   \node[triangle points left,  text=green!50] at (0,1) 
      {\vrule height 10pt width 20pt};
   \node[triangle points down,  text=blue!50]  at (0,0) 
      {\vrule height 20pt width 10pt};
   \node[triangle points right, text=black!50] at (1,0) 
      {\vrule height 10pt width 20pt};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

	Minimum size and minimum width requirements ensure the literal 
	width and height of the triangle, but in order to keep the apex 
	angle the same, increasing the height will increase the width 
	and vice versa. 
   
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[simple isosceles triangle, draw, inner sep=0pt, 
      anchor=point 2]
   \draw[help lines] grid(4,2);
   \foreach \a/\c in {1.5/blue, 1/green, 0.5/red}{
      \color{\c}
      \node[minimum height=\a cm] at (0,0) {};
      \node[minimum width=\a cm] at (2,0) {};
   }
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}	

	There are \pgfname{} commands and \tikzname{} options to set the 
  	apex angle of the triangle, and the rotation of the triangle border.
  	The \pgfname{} commands are as follows:
    
  \begin{command}{\pgfsettriangleapexangle\marg{angle}}
    Sets the angle of the apex of the isosceles triangle. The height
    and width of the triangle may be adjusted to maintain this
    angle.
  \end{command}
  
  \begin{command}{\pgfsettrianglerotate\marg{angle}}
    Rotates the border of the triangle, independently of the node contents,
    but subject to any coordinate or canvas transformations. Note, that the
    |simple isosceles triangle| rounds \meta{angle} to the nearest multiple of 90.
  \end{command}
  
  The \tikzname{} options are:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemoption{isosceles triangle apex angle}|=|\meta{angle}
    set the angle of the apex of the isosceles triangle.
    
    \itemoption{isosceles triangle rotate}|=|\meta{angle}
    rotate the isosceles triangle shape border indepently of the node contents.
    The |simple isosceles triangle| rounds \meta{angle} to the nearest multiple of 90.
    There are `shorthand' versions for particular angles:
    
    \itemoption{triangle points up} 
    rotate the border 90 degrees.
    \itemoption{triangle points down} 
    rotate the border 270 degrees.
    \itemoption{triangle points left}
    rotate the border 180 degrees.
    \itemoption{triangle points right}
    rotate the border 0 degrees.
    \itemoption{triangle points north} 
    rotate the border 90 degrees.
    \itemoption{triangle points south}
    rotate the border 270 degrees.
    \itemoption{triangle points west}
    rotate the border 180 degrees.
    \itemoption{triangle points east}
    rotate the border 0 degrees.
    
  \end{itemize}
  
  The anchors for the simple isosceles triangle are shown below. 
  Anchor |110| is an example of a border anchor.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s, shape=simple isosceles triangle, triangle points east,
        isosceles triangle apex angle=55, style=shape example, inner sep=0.5cm] 
    {Simple Isosceles Triangle\vrule width 1pt height 1.5cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {point 1/above, point 2/above, point 3/below, apex/below,
     side 1/above,  side 2/above,  side 3/below,  center/above,  
     mid/left,      base/below,    text/below,     north/above,
     south/below,   east/left,     west/below,    110/above,
     north west/above, north east/right,
     south west/above, south east/right}
  \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
    node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{shape}

\begin{shape}{isosceles triangle}
	Like the |simple isosceles triangle|, this shape is an isosceles triangle.
	However, the border of this triangle is drawn so that it encompasses
	the incircle, that is, the circle that tightly fits the node contents,
	whilst maintaining the required apex angle (which again defaults to
	45 degrees).
	
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[shape=isosceles triangle, 
      isosceles triangle apex angle=\a*10, draw, inner sep=2pt]
   \foreach \a in {2,4,6}\node at (\a*.65,0) {A};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}	

   Like the |simple isosceles triangle|, minimum size and minimum 
   width requirements ensure the literal width and height of the 
   triangle, and, in order to keep the apex angle the same, increasing
   the height will increase the width and vice versa.    
   
   However, because the |isosceles triangle| shape uses the incircle
   to determine its border, the border can be \emph{arbitrarily} rotated 
   independently of the node contents (but in addition to any canvas 
   transformations). By default, this rotation is set to 90 
   degrees.
	
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[isosceles triangle, draw, anchor=side 2]
   \draw[help lines] grid(3,1);
   \node at (1,0) {A};
   \node[isosceles triangle rotate=33.6] at (2,0) {B};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}	

	The |isosceles triangle| shape can use the same \pgfname{} commands,
	and \tikzname{} options as the |simple isosceles triangle| to set
	the apex angle and the rotation of the triangle border (see above).  
   The anchors for this isosceles triangle are shown below.
   The anchor |75| is an example of a border anchor.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s, shape=isosceles triangle, style=shape example,
        inner sep=0cm, isosceles triangle apex angle=42.5] 
        {Isosceles Triangle\vrule width 1pt height 1cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {apex/below,   point 1/above, point 2/above, point 3/above, 
     side 1/above, side 2/above,  side 3/above,  mid/right,      
     base/below,   center/above,  text/left,     75/above,
     north/left,   south/below,   east/above,    west/above,
     north west/below, north east/below,
     south west/below, south east/below}
  \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
    node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

\end{shape}


\begin{shape}{semicircle}
	
	This shape is a semicircle, which tightly fits the node contents.
	The border can be rotated independently of the node contents to
	0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees (this rotation is in addition to any
	other transformations). By default the semicircle is drawn with
	a rotation of 90 degrees.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
   \tikzstyle{every node}=[semicircle, draw]
   \node[text=red!50] at (1,1) {\vrule height 10pt width 20pt};
   \node[semicircle rotate=180,  text=green!50] at (0,1) 
      {\vrule height 20pt width 10pt};
   \node[semicircle rotate=270,  text=blue!50]  at (0,0) 
      {\vrule height 10pt width 20pt};
   \node[semicircle rotate=0, text=black!50] at (1,0) 
      {\vrule height 20pt width 10pt};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

	The rotation of the semicircle can be set using a \pgfname{} command,
	or a \tikzname{} option:
    
  \begin{command}{\pgfsetsemicirclerotate\marg{angle}}
    Rotates the border of the semicircle, independently of the node contents,
    but subject to any coordinate or canvas transformations. Note, that the
    |semicircle| shape rounds \meta{angle} to the nearest multiple of 90.
  \end{command}
  
  The corresponding \tikzname{} option is:
  
  \begin{itemize}
   
    \itemoption{semicircle rotate}|=|\meta{angle}
    rotate the border indepently of the node contents.
    The |semicircle| rounds \meta{angle} to the nearest multiple of 90.
    
  \end{itemize}
  
  The anchors for the |semicircle| shape are shown below. 
  Anchor |30| is an example of a border anchor.
  
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s,shape=semicircle,style=shape example, inner sep=2cm] 
  	{Semicircle\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {apex/above,   arc start/below, arc end/below, chord center/below,
     center/above, base/below,      mid/right,     text/left,
     north/below,  south/above,     east/above,    west/above,
     north west/above left, north east/above right, 
     south west/below,      south east/below, 30/right}
     \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
       node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

\end{shape}

\begin{shape}{star}
  This shape is a star, which by default (minus any transformations) is
  drawn with the first point pointing	upwards.
  A star should be thought of as having an set of ``inner points'' and
  and ``outer points''. These points form the principle anchors for the
  star, as shown below (anchor |75| is an example of a border anchor).
  
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s, shape=star, star points=5, star point ratio=1.5, style=shape example, inner sep=1.5cm] 
    {Star\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
     {inner point 1/above, inner point 2/above, inner point 3/below, 
      inner point 4/right, inner point 5/above, outer point 1/above, 
      outer point 2/above, outer point 3/left,  outer point 4/right, 
      outer point 5/above, mid/right,           base/below, 
      center/above,        text/left,           75/above}
  \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
    node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

  The inner points of the border are based on the radius of the circle
  which tightly fits the node contents. 
  Any specified minimum size, width or height, is interpreted as the 
  diameter of the circle that passes through every outer point. 
  
  There are \pgfname{} commands and \tikzname{} options to set various
  parameters for the star, such as the number of points, the height of
  the points and the rotation of the star border. 
  
  The \pgfname{} commands are as follows:
  
  \begin{command}{\pgfsetstarpoints\marg{integer}}
    Sets the number of points for the star.
  \end{command}
  
  \begin{command}{\pgfsetstarpointheight\marg{distance}}
    Sets the height of the star points. This is the distance between the
    inner point and outer point radii. If the star is enlarged to some
    specified minimum size, the inner radius is increased to maintain
    the point height.	
  \end{command}
  
  \begin{command}{\pgfsetstarpointratio\marg{number}}
    Sets the ratio between the outer point and inner point radii.		
    If the star is enlarged to some specified minimum size, the
    inner radius is increased to maintain the ratio.	
  \end{command}
  
  \begin{command}{\pgfsetstarrotate\marg{angle}}
    Rotates the border of the star, independently of the node contents,
    but subject to any coordinate or canvas transformations.	
  \end{command}
  
  The corresponding \tikzname{} options are:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemoption{star points}|=|\meta{integer}
    set the number of points for the star.
    
    \itemoption{star point height}|=|\meta{distance}
    set the height of the points for the star.
    
    \itemoption{star point ratio}|=|\meta{number}
    set the ratio between the outer point radius and the inner point
    radius.
    
    \itemoption{star rotate}|=|\meta{angle}
    rotate the star shape border indepently of the node contents.
    
  \end{itemize}
\end{shape}



\subsection{Symbol Shapes}

\begin{pgflibrary}{shapes.symbols}
  This library defines shapes that can be used for drawing symbols
  like a forbidden sign or a cloud.
\end{pgflibrary}



\begin{shape}{forbidden sign}
  This shape places the node inside a circle with a diagonal from the
  lower left to the upper right added. The circle is part of the
  background, the diagonal line part of the foreground path; thus, the
  diagonal line is on top of the text.
  
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node [forbidden sign,line width=1ex,draw=red,fill=white] {Smoking};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

  The shape inherits all anchors from the |circle| shape, see also the
  following figure:
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s,shape=forbidden sign,style=shape example] {Forbidden\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {north west/above left, north/above, north east/above right, 
     west/left, center/above, east/right, 
     mid west/right, mid/above, mid east/left, 
     base west/left, base/below, base east/right, 
     south west/below left, south/below, south east/below right, 
     text/left, 10/right, 130/above}
     \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
       node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{shape}



\subsection{Shapes with Multiple Text Parts}

\begin{pgflibrary}{shapes.multipart}
  This library defines general-purpose shapes that are composed of
  multiple (text) parts. 
\end{pgflibrary}


\begin{shape}{circle split}
  This shape is a multi-part shape consisting of a circle with a line
  in the middle. The upper part is the main part (the |text| part),
  the lower part is the |lower| part.
  
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node [circle split,draw,double,fill=red!20]
  {
    $q_1$
    \nodepart{lower}
    $00$
  };
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

  The shape inherits all anchors from the |circle| shape and defines
  the |lower| anchor in addition. See also the
  following figure:
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s,shape=circle split,style=shape example] {text\nodepart{lower}lower};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {north west/above left, north/above, north east/above right, 
     west/left, center/below, east/right, 
     mid west/right, mid/above, mid east/left, 
     base west/left, base/below, base east/right, 
     south west/below left, south/below, south east/below right, 
     text/left, lower/left, 130/above}
     \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
       node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{shape}


\subsection{Miscellaneous Shapes}

\begin{pgflibrary}{shapes.misc}
  This library defines general-purpose shapes that do not fit in the
  previous categories.
\end{pgflibrary}



\begin{shape}{cross out}
  This shape ``crosses out'' the node. Its foreground path are simply
  two diagonal lines that between the corners of the node's bounding
  box. Here is an example:

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \node [cross out,draw=red] at (1.5,1) {cross out};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

  A useful application is inside text as in the following example:
\begin{codeexample}[]
Cross \tikz[baseline] \node [cross out,draw,anchor=text] {me}; out!  
\end{codeexample}

  This shape inherits all anchors from the |rectangle| shape, see also
  the following figure:
\begin{codeexample}[]
\Huge
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[name=s,shape=cross out,style=shape example] {cross out\vrule width 1pt height 2cm};
  \foreach \anchor/\placement in
    {north west/above left, north/above, north east/above right, 
     west/left, center/above, east/right, 
     mid west/right, mid/above, mid east/left, 
     base west/left, base/below, base east/right, 
     south west/below left, south/below, south east/below right, 
     text/left, 10/right, 130/above}
     \draw[shift=(s.\anchor)] plot[mark=x] coordinates{(0,0)}
       node[\placement] {\scriptsize\texttt{(s.\anchor)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{shape}

\begin{shape}{strike out}
  This shape is idential to the |cross out| shape, only its foreground
  path consists of a single line from the lower left to the upper
  right.
  
\begin{codeexample}[]
Strike \tikz[baseline] \node [strike out,draw,anchor=text] {me}; out!  
\end{codeexample}

  See the |cross out| shape for the anchors.
\end{shape}
