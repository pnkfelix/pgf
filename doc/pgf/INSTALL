Installing pgf:
---------------

For the impatient: 
- Put the whole pgf directory somewhere where TeX can find them.
- Install the xcolor package version 2.00.

Long version:
In the manual, which you find in the file doc/pgf/en/pgfmanual.pdf,
you will find a detailed explanation on how to install pgf.
