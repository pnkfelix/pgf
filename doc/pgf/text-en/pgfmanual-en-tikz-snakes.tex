\section{Snakes -- How To Make a Line Squiggle}

In \tikzname\ it is easy enough to draw a straight line from a point
$A$ to another point~$B$. In many situations it would, however, be
useful to draw the line in a more fancy way. For example, it might be
useful to a zig-zag curve instead of a straight line or a coil or
perhaps a sine curve (which looks like a snake).

\tikzname\ and \pgfname\ use a new concept that I termed \emph{snakes}
for drawing lines in special ways. A snake specifies a way of
extending a path between two points in a ``fancy manner.'' Note that
snakes only extend the path, so they can be used, for example, as part
of the border of an object. Here are some examples:

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]
  \draw                                        (0,3)   -- (3,3);
  \draw[snake=zigzag]                          (0,2.5) -- (3,2.5);
  \draw[snake=brace]                           (0,2)   -- (3,2);
  \draw[snake=triangle]                        (0,1.5) -- (3,1.5);
  \draw[snake=coil,segment length=4pt]         (0,1)   -- (3,1);
  \draw[snake=coil,segment aspect=0]           (0,.5)  -- (3,.5);
  \draw[snake=expanding waves,segment angle=7] (0,0)   -- (3,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \filldraw[fill=red!20,snake=bumps] (0,0) rectangle (3,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \filldraw[fill=blue!20]              (0,3)
  [snake=saw]                       -- (3,3)
  [snake=coil,segment aspect=0]     -- (3,1)
  [snake=bumps]                     -- (0,2)
                                    -- cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
